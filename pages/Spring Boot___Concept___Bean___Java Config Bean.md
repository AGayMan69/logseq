- > Make the existing third-party class available to the Spring framework
- Typically, if we need make class as a java bean, we have to add [@Component](Spring Boot/Concept/Bean/Component) to the class's source code
- But with the third-party class, we are not able to change the source code of the class
- **How it works**
	- Create `@Configuration` class
	- Define `@Bean` method to configure the bean
	- For example, see [[Spring Boot/Annotation/Bean/Java Config Bean]]
