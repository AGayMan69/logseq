- ==Auto configuration==
	- `@EnableAutoConfiguration` enables [[Spring Boot]]'s auto-configuration support
-
- ==Component scanning==
	- `@ComponentScan` enables [[Spring Boot]]'s component scanning of **current package** and scan sub-packages recursively
	-
	- By default, [[Spring Boot]] starts component scanning from the **same package** as your main Spring Boot application, and **sub-packages** recursively
	- Implicitly defines a base search package, which means no need to explicitly reference the base package name
	- For other packages to scan by [[Spring Boot]], use [scanBasePackages](Spring Boot/Annotation/Component Scanning/scanBasePackages) to explicitly to list the base packages to scan
